| C-x u   | undo last change                         |

* ToDo [8/11]
- [X] copy, paste and cut shortcuts?
- [X] use .emacs.d/init.el instead of .emacs
- [X] use org-babel and org-mode for init.el for doc
- [X] Help on keys?
- [X] Help on commands
- [X] write help in org-mode
- [X] reconfigure backup path
- [X] snippets? (e.g. SRC-blocks)
- [ ] pdftools?
- [ ] agenda view in org-mode?
- [ ] INFO: Shift for selection does not work in org-mode
